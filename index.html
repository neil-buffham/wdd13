            Hello all, this is Neil Buffham, and I am studying Computer Engineering. I enjoy tinkering with electronics, reading/audiobooks when I get the chance, and some light gaming. I dabble in CAD and 3d printing, and worked with a small IT business before college. I am taking web fundamentals (as well as some other classes) to build a basic programming/web background for further tinkering/projects. I am a lifelong member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, and a favorite quote/principle of mine has been "things to act and things to be acted upon," from both 2 Nephi 2:14, and Elder Bednar's "And Nothing Shall Offend Them," on the subject.
