        Content

      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        Purpose:
	People will visit the site to compare different Lenovo laptop specifications to each other, search for laptops by multiple criteria, and download official specs sheets to review for themselves.

Questions/Activities:
	Due to my limited abilities in databases and Python, we will limit “questions” to allowing the user to select three criteria out of the list of specs, and input/select a value for each. For example:
	Display outputs: 1/2/3/etc.
	Display outputs include: HDMI (and/or) Thunderbolt (and/or) VGA (and/or) etc.
	USB C ports: 1/2/3/4/etc.
	Removable Battery: Yes/No

Structure:
	Ideally the site should be limited to as few pages as possible. Ideally, this would mean the filter criteria delivering a columned list, where the rows are laptop models and the columns are specifications. In a perfect world, there would be links to download official specs sheets and or to outside pertinent information. In order to fill criteria, we will have a sub page that provides the context of the website’s creation (for the user to understand the amateur nature of the data composition), as well as a second sub page that will probably be a photo gallery.

Necessary information: 
The compiled laptop specifications, which I am pretty close to completing for Lenovo.
Official specs sheets, which I have been gathering along the way.
Some relevant laptop images? There will be images, I’m just not sure if this is where we will do it.

Competitive edge:
	Any laptop manufacturer is biased to sell you on a new laptop. I am set to make $0 from this at all, let alone from selling you something new. This website will allow for easy comparison between laptops within roughly twenty years, at first between Lenovo, and then hopefully between other manufacturers down the road, which individual OEMs are certain to not provide as a service. Official websites like Lenovo PSREF play into this bias heavily, only allowing comparison for fairly recent laptops.

Alternatives:
Lenovo PSREF: provides very detailed information about an astronomical number of laptops, but search-by-specs is limited to laptops ranging from current to 12th gen intel (2022). By definition, the authoritative source for specific questions on a singular, or up to four Lenovo laptops in direct comparison, but doesn’t compare things like maximum memory. Tons of data, but it doesn’t hit the US-based-geek comparison need.
Wikipedia: not always complete or accurate, lacks tools to directly compare different laptops, but contains a much more palatable listing of the laptops generally available in the US. (PSREF often will have datasheets for thousands of specs configurations for a single model worldwide, and as many as 50 for the US alone.)
nanoreview.com: Doesn’t compare that old of laptops
gadgets360.com: Doesn’t display more enthusiast-geared specs such as number of ram slots, maximum memory, interface of storage devices, or different production options of models (ex: this model could come with a touchscreen, but not all of them did)
versus.com: Aesthetic website that offers relatively helpful information and has a lot of comparison options, but the data isn’t filled out very thoroughly, or displayed in a very digestible way. There are more configuration (max ram) options, but the breadth of the comparable brands means the individual points of comparison often are 2 known to one unknown or more if you are comparing older items. Pretty decent option. The unique competitive advantage we would present is in complete representation of the specs sheets among a smaller sample size. Rather than contrasting the virtues of macbook vs thinkpad vs surface, it will granulate which thinkpad does exactly what you are looking for, with the official data right handy. 
noteb.com: very granular source for newer laptops. A little tricky to navigate, and doesn’t have older laptops. It would be a great resource for those who care about current support. Again, great resource.
PCGameBenchmark: does exactly what it sounds like. A little bit of specs comparison, but mostly just “select the specs of the laptop and view frame rates in these games” type of thing.
smartprix.com: based out of India, all the prices are in ₹, and while it offers many older laptops for comparison, the few I tested sometimes had zero values populated for comparison, which is a little ironic.
dell.com: (I kid you not)
(Also just want to sell you new stuff)

Conclusion:
	This website does not provide a unique service for those who want to casually compare laptops. The real benefit, put bluntly, is to allow very granular comparisons by the “Thinkpad fan base” between models within the age range still usable by people who require newer than Windows XP but aren’t locked into the latest and greatest models. This is a large project for a novice, and I will do what I can to complete it while taking necessary cuts to meet requirements for the assignment in a realistic and timely fashion. I intend to finish it, but will realistically need more knowledge than I will gain in the next four to five weeks to implement it cleanly at full capacity.
