      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn. You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

        <tr><th>Primary</th><th>Secondary</th><th>Accent 1</th><th>Accent 2</th></tr>

      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

      <h4>
        Heading Font: [Inter]  <!-- It's just different enough to be a header -->

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: [Roboto]  <!-- It's readable enough for the data that will be displayed-->

      <h3>Context</h3>
      <p>
        This website was created as a college project by someone with limited programming knowledge and weeks of experience in web design. Please take the information here with whatever scrutiny you deem needful. While diligence has been taken to preserve data accuracy, this is effectively a work of passion in spare time. Please consider referring to the specs sheets themselves before making any decisions of importance. While here, please enjoy these generated images that I am allowed to use, as many of the pertinent photos and all of the important logos that will be referenced throughout the site are copyright protected.

      <h3>Image Gallery</h3>
      <p>
        These images replace (for the time being) the images that I am trying to not be copyright struck by lenovo for presenting. Until I can assure we won't be in legal trouble for showing off the aesthetics of Thinkpads, these will have to suffice.
